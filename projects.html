        <br>Our team struggled in achieving the goal but we learned a lot about problem-solving and team synergy along the way.
        <br>In the end, our robot did not completely achieve the goal of object location and detection. We only tagged half of the objects placed in the arena. We analyzed our errors after the demonstration and recorded ways that we could improve the project.

(You can see the source code on the Github link below.) Later projects in the semester included visualize data and design graphs using D3 and JavaScript, create MapReduce applications with Hadoop and Pig, etc.
        <br>I thoroughly enjoyed every single project in this class. The finished products looked gorgeous and made me feel a sense of accomplishment.
        <br>The class also helped me narrow down the focus of my Computer Science minor to concentrate on Computational Data Analysis.I wish to learn more in this concentration in the future to strengthen my skills as a programmer!`

The drone with accompanying tablet will provide real-time results to the inspection-operator.
