                <p>
                    During the digital marketing course, I had the opportunity to work the Yardstick Management to develop a comprehensive digital marketing plan in order to boost their online presence and gain visibility for certain clienteles.

                    For the video game design class, my team and I created EvoSlash, a zombie survival game with minimal environment exploration and level up options. I took the lead on artistic and musical design, as well as creating and editing the trailer video for our game. The trailer is linked in the text above.

                <h2>DIANA - Drone Inspection Assistant for Navigable Aircraft</h2>


                <p>
                    Drone Inspection Assistant of Navigable Aircraft (DIANA) is a proof of concept system for inspection automation of aircrafts, buildings, and other infrastructures. Using DIANA to perform visual inspections ensures the safety of the inspectors as well as the efficiency of the inspection process. DIANA aids in conducting routine maintenance and inspections for concrete structures and infrastructure by reducing the time, cost, and risk from current practices. The drone with accompanying tablet will provide real-time results to the inspection-operator.
                    <br>Most of the efforts of our team were allocated to training a neural network, automating flight path, and creating a fully integrated demonstratable system. Check out some of project results below.
                    <br>We also attended and presented our project at the Spring 2019 Georgia Tech Capstone Design Expo, one of the largest student design expos in the U.S.

                <p>
                    The motivation behind Interesting Updates is to cut out the time spent searching for articles a user is interested in and present them with those articles up front. Interesting Updates customizes feeds to a personal level by picking up on a user's interests by monitoring trends in searches and web history.
                    <br>Users do not interfere with the data collection process that molds their news feed. Articles are then presented via speech or on screen. The users can also choose to ask for a summary of the article and an NLP text-rank algorithm will give them a brief summary.

                    VNL (Volleyball Nations League) is an international volleyball competition between the best nations in the world. I absolutely love watching the best players compete against each other and representing their home nations.
                    <br>In order to get a better idea of how the teams are doing in the competition during the 5-week long preliminary round, I created this simple visualization of the match results of the 16 teams. I used BeautifulSoup to scrape the data, then created the visualization with D3.js.

                    This class is by far my favorite class that I have taken at Georgia Tech. Through various projects over the semester, I had learned many valuable and indispensable skills and renewed my love for computer programming.
                    <br>The very first project of the semester was to collect and visualize data from Twitter of a given user by using Python and the Twitter API. (You can see the source code on the Github link below.) Later projects in the semester included visualize data and design graphs using D3 and JavaScript, create MapReduce applications with Hadoop and Pig, etc.
                    <br>I thoroughly enjoyed every single project in this class. The finished products looked gorgeous and made me feel a sense of accomplishment.
                    <br>The class also helped me narrow down the focus of my Computer Science minor to concentrate on Computational Data Analysis.I wish to learn more in this concentration in the future to strengthen my skills as a programmer!

                    This project was to create a web application mock-up for users to create and manage MARTA (Atlanta Subway) cards and trips.
                    <br>The application was created with PHP and CSS on the front-end in coordination with database manipulation and organization using phpMyAdmin and SQL on the back-end.

                    The goal of this team project is to design and program a modified AmigoBot using Assembly(MIPS) and Quartus II program to achieve the objective of detecting and locating objects in an arena.
                    <br>This project included a technical report as well as a team presentation. (Both are attached below for reference.)
                    <br>Our team struggled in achieving the goal but we learned a lot about problem-solving and team synergy along the way.
                    <br>In the end, our robot did not completely achieve the goal of object location and detection. We only tagged half of the objects placed in the arena. We analyzed our errors after the demonstration and recorded ways that we could improve the project.
                    <br>Some reports from the individual labs during the semester are also linked below.
