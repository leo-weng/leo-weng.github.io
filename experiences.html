                        I had the pleasure to work with MeS in the payment processing industry as a software engineering intern in the Quality Assurance department. After taking the time to understand the industry and how payment processing works, I dove straight into working with the engineering teams on the different financial platforms offered by MeS to their merchants.
                        <br>I worked mainly on their Virtual Terminal, a web-based portal allowing merchants to process payments for their customers, including functions such as basic transactions, Level II and III payments, tip processing, export reports, etc.
                        <br>I worked with two other interns to put together a complete automated regression suite for VT. Using mainly Selenium and TestNG for the automation of tests, the regression suite makes sure all the functions work properly and that no bugs are present. The complete suite automated the execution and analyzing of more than 110 test cases, saving time and resources that previously had to spent manually.
                        <br>In future updates to VT, the regression suite will allow testing for existing and new functions and save even more time with the automated tests.
