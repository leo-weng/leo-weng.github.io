                    I am worked at Hydronix as a web developer. My tasks include technical aspects of software development as well as the creative aspecs of website design.
                    <br>I was in charge of maintaining, updating, and monitoring hosted websites and managing site security. I also worked on designing, testing, and implementing custom website pages and forms. I worked extensively with HTML, PHP, and CSS through platforms like Shopify, Wordpress, Joomla, and Magento.

                    I had the pleasure to work with MeS in the payment processing industry as a software engineering intern in the Quality Assurance department. After taking the time to understand the industry and how payment processing works, I dove straight into working with the engineering teams on the different financial platforms offered by MeS to their merchants.
                    <br>I worked mainly on their Virtual Terminal, a web-based portal allowing merchants to process payments for their customers, including functions such as basic transactions, Level II and III payments, tip processing, export reports, etc.
                    <br>I worked with two other interns to put together a complete automated regression suite for VT. Using mainly Selenium and TestNG for the automation of tests, the regression suite makes sure all the functions work properly and that no bugs are present. The complete suite automated the execution and analyzing of more than 110 test cases, saving time and resources that previously had to spent manually.
                    <br>In future updates to VT, the regression suite will allow testing for existing and new functions and save even more time with the automated tests.

                    I coordinated a project to create a FAQ database to increase employee productivity by reducing search time.
                    <br>In order to allow ease of access for the users of this web application (employees of the company), I handled details in the web design formatting with HTML and CSS.
                    <br>I also managed and maintained back-end database with MySQL and jQuery in coordination with the front-end interface.
